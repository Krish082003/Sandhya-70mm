            <p>Situated in that giant melting pot of Hyderabad movie fans, the redoubtable RTC X Roads, Sandhya 70 is the main theater for major Telugu films, and the capital of the area. You'd spot intimidating cut-outs of the lead star of the film currently on from a galaxy away, and a festive look adorns the hall with banners by fan clubs all around and a general flowery splendor about the edifice.

                The innards of Sandhya 70 are shockingly spacious. The curvaceous screen, crystal clear sound, the secularity of seating everyone sits on the same level, and even the 10 rupee ticket guys get away without having to risk Spondylitis all add up to a near perfect movie-going experience. And lest midway through you forget what movie you are watching known to happen quite often with Telugu cinema the name is embossed in floral grandeur below the screen</p>
